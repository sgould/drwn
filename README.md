====

This is the main software repository for the Darwin machine learning
library. You probably want to get the latest version (master) or one
of the stable releases. To get the latest development version use one
of the following:

    git clone https://github.com/sgould/drwn.git darwin
    git clone git@github.com:sgould/drwn.git darwin
    svn co https://github.com/sgould/drwn darwin

Stable releases can be downloaded from
    http://github.com/sgould/drwn/releases/

If you have previously checked out code with "git clone" then you can
obtain the latest changes with:

    cd darwin; git pull
