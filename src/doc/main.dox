\section Introduction

This document describes the design and usage of the \b Darwin
framework for machine learning and computer vision research and
development. It includes an overview of the various \ref drwnLibs
"components" of the framework, \ref drwnDownload "installation instructions",
and \ref drwnTutorial "tutorial". The document assumes
that you are familiar with either the Linux or Windows (Microsoft
Visual Studio) C/C++ development environments and have a basic
understanding of Machine Learning, e.g., as presented in a number of
excellent texts:

   \li Richard O. Duda and Peter E. Hart and David G. Stork, "Pattern Classification", 2000.
   \li Christopher M. Bishop, "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning", 2007.
   \li Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman,
   "The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction", 2009.
   \li Daphne Koller and Nir Friedman, "Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques", 2009.
   \li Kevin Murphy, "Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Approach", 2012.

For computer vision the following texts are recommended:

   \li Richard Szeliski, "Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications", 2010. 
   \li Simon Prince, "Computer Vision: Models, Learning, and Inference", 2012.
   \li Gary Bradski and Adrian Kaehler, "Learning OpenCV", 2008.

The \b Darwin framework is designed to make it easy for researchers to
share code that makes use of the \b Darwin libraries. The basic
structure is shown in the figure below where \b Darwin applications
and projects link against the \b Darwin libraries, which in turn link
against a small set of external (third-party) libraries. Individual
projects may include full-blown machine learning applications or
reference code to replicate results from scientific
publications. Individual projects may also link against other external
libraries. The \b Darwin libraries are outlined in more detail below
(see \ref drwnLibs).

project. They are listed \ref drwnAcknowledgments "here".

\section drwnLibs Darwin Libraries

The following (clickable) diagram shows the dependencies between \b
Darwin libraries. Dashed external libraries are optional. However,
some functionality may not be available without these libraries.

digraph dependencies {
  rankdir=BT;
  node [shape=rectangle, fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=10, height=0.3];

  subgraph clusterLibs {
    fontname=Helvetica; fontsize=12; color=grey; labeljust="r";
    label="darwin libraries";

    drwnBase [URL="\ref drwnBase"];
    drwnIO [URL="\ref drwnIO"];
    drwnML [URL="\ref drwnML"];
    drwnPGM [URL="\ref drwnPGM"];
    drwnVision [URL="\ref drwnVision"];

    drwnIO -> drwnBase;
    // drwnML -> drwnBase;
    // drwnVision -> drwnBase;
    drwnML -> drwnIO;
    drwnPGM -> drwnIO;
    // drwnVision -> drwnIO;
    drwnVision -> drwnML;
    drwnVision -> drwnPGM;
  }

  subgraph clusterExt {
    fontname=Helvetica; fontsize=12; color=grey; labeljust="r";
    label="externals";

    Eigen3 [URL="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org"];
    RapidXML [URL="http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/"];
    RapidJSON [URL="http://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson"];
    node [style=dashed];
    zlib [URL="http://www.zlib.org/"];
    OpenCV [URL="http://code.opencv.org"];
  }

  drwnBase -> RapidJSON;
  drwnBase -> RapidXML;
  drwnBase -> Eigen3;
  edge [style=dashed];
  drwnIO -> zlib;
  drwnVision -> OpenCV;
}
\enddot

\li The \ref drwnBase library provides a number of core utility
classes such as command line processing, code profiling, and message
logging that are used throughout the rest of the library. All
applications that use the \b Darwin framework must include drwnBase.h
and link against this library.

\li The \ref drwnIO library provides input/output functionality such
as data storage in uncompressed or compressed format (provided by
zlib). Applications using the i/o library should include the drwnIO.h
header file.

\li The \ref drwnML library provides basic machine learning capability
for optimization, classification, regression and modeling probability
distributions. Applications using the machine learning library should
include the drwnML.h header file.

\li The \ref drwnPGM library provides infrastructure for inference and
learning in probabilistic graphical models. Applications using the PGM
library should include the drwnPGM.h header file.

\li The \ref drwnVision library provided high-level computer vision
routines. It requires OpenCV (http://code.opencv.org). Client
code using the computer vision library should include the drwnVision.h
header file. This library is optional.

\section drwnApps Applications and Projects

The \b Darwin framework includes many pre-developed applications for
and projects for common machine learning and computer vision
problems. For example, one of the projects provides \ref
drwnProjMatlab "mex interfaces" for accessing many components of the
library from Matlab; other projects integrate various components of
the library through small utility applications and Python scripts. See
\ref drwnApplications for details.

There is also a short \ref drwnTutorial "tutorial" that you should
read if you are new to the library.

\section drwnDownload Downloading and Installing

\b Darwin has minimal dependencies on external libraries. Small
libraries such as \ref RapidXML and \ref RapidJSON are included in the
distribution, but larger libraries, such as \ref Eigen and \ref
OpenCV, need to be installed separately. \b Darwin source code is
hosted at http://github.com/sgould/drwn/. The following links provide
detailed download and install instructions for Windows, Linux and Mac
OS X.

\li \ref linuxInstall
\li \ref winInstall
\li \ref osxInstall

The latest stable release can be downloaded from this 
<a href="https://github.com/sgould/drwn/releases/latest">link</a>.

Previous stable releases, pre-compiled Windows and Matlab mex
binaries, and change logs are also \ref drwnDownloadsDoc "available".

Please report bugs via the issue tracker https://github.com/sgould/drwn/issues 
or email to stephen.gould@anu.edu.au and include a small example (code
and data) that will trigger the bug.
